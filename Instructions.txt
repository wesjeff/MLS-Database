READ BEFORE STARTING ANYTHING

1) You need to install XAMPP, pretty straight forward.

It will install to C:\xampp
After it installs, put the PHP files here:

C:\xampp\htdocs\COP4710
(You'll need to make the COP4710 folder)


2) Install MySQL Workbench - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=544368

Don't make an account, just click "No thanks, just start my download"


3) Start XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL. THEN open MySQL Workbench


4) Download files from GitHub. Put the .php files in C:\xampp\htdocs\COP4710, then put all the other files wherever you want, their location does not matter.


5) Open the 2-WORKING and 3-WORKING SQL scripts, run them in that order


6) Navigate in your browser to http://localhost/COP4710/index.php. If you see "Welcome to MLS Database, you did it right
